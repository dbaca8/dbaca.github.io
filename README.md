## Blackbody Radiation
## Planck's Law

Planck's law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium, emissivity=1, at a given temperature T, where there is zero net flow of matter or energy between the body and its environment.

Planck's Law (Wavelength):
$${\displaystyle B_{\lambda }(\lambda ,T)={\frac {2hc^{2}}{\lambda ^{5}}}{\frac {1}{e^{(hc/\lambda kT)}-1}}}$$
Planck's Law (Frequency):
$${\displaystyle B(\nu ,T)={\frac {2h\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}{\frac {1}{e^{{(h\nu/ }{kT})}-1}}}$$

Planck's constant: h = 6.625 x 10^-34 J⋅sec     
Boltzmann constant: $k$ =  1.380649×10^-23 J⋅K^−1     
speed of light: c = 2.99792458 x 10^8 m⋅sec^-1     
Wavelength = lambda (m)     
Temperature = T (K)




Wien's constant for wavelength $b_\lambda$ = 2.897771955×10^(−3) m⋅K   

### Wien's Law for wavelength
$${\displaystyle \lambda _{\text{peak}}={\frac {b_\lambda}{T}}}$$



Wien's constant for frequency $b_\nu$ = 5.88 * 10^(10) Hz⋅K^-1   

### Wien's Law for frequency
$${\displaystyle \nu _{\text{peak}}={{b_\nu}*{T}}}$$
